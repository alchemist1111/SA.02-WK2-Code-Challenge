## Description.
This code challenge has three types of challenges;
1. String Swap.
   This challenge has a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

2. Generating array.
   This challenge has a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

3. Efficient Prime Number Filtering Function for Arrays.
   This challenge has function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.The function accurately and efficiently identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array? For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].

## Installation Instruction.
Find the Repository: Go to the GitHub repository page that you want to clone.

Get the Clone URL: Click on the "Code" button, and then copy the URL provided. It will look something like this:          
               https://github.com/username/repository.git

Open Terminal or Command Prompt: Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.

Clone the Repository: Once you're in the desired directory, use the git clone command followed by the URL you copied earlier. For example:

                  git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

Verify: Once the cloning process is complete, you should see the repository files in the directory you specified.
